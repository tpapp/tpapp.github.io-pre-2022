    <content type="html" xml:base="https://tpapp.github.io/post/privacy-badger/">&lt;p&gt;Firefox has been my primary browser for the last decade. I find it very fast and convenient, and use quite a few addons, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/google-scholar-button/&#34;&gt;Google Scholar Button&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-gb/firefox/addon/noscript/?src=search&#34;&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/&#34;&gt;uBlock Origin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly when, but about half a year ago various sites started to break. I have not bothered to debug what&amp;rsquo;s happening, suspecting it was was a combination of various plugins, but continued to use Firefox and installed &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/darktrojan/openwith&#34;&gt;openwith&lt;/a&gt; to open broken pages in Chromium (yes, I know, the ultimate kludge). More sites became broken, and I found that now I am spending 99% of my time in Chromium, which I don&amp;rsquo;t like that much, but moreover, it is a resource hog: while using the plugins above I can get the CPU load of Firefox to around 1&amp;ndash;2% when I am not using it, Chromium drains my laptop battery in effectively half the time. To make things worse, Chromium apparently can&amp;rsquo;t open links in the background like Firefox, and insists on raising the window every time I open a link from another process, which is distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.julialang.org/&#34;&gt;Julia&amp;rsquo;s Discourse forum&lt;/a&gt; started showing up empty, which was the last straw and I went through my plugins. It turns out hat &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eff.org/privacybadger&#34;&gt;Privacy Badger&lt;/a&gt; was responsible for everything: apparently it relies on heavy-handed heuristics and breaks a lot of webpages. One can report this, but instead of reporting around 10&amp;ndash;20 pages which were broken, I simply removed the plugin. I have a lot of respect for what the Electronic Frontier Foundation does, but I am not sure that this plugin is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So finally I got back the web the way I like it. Moral of the story: temporary workarounds become permanent, and bite back.&lt;/p&gt;
