      <description>Introduction MCMC samples, used in Bayesian statistics, are not independent &amp;mdash; in fact, unless one uses specialized methods or modern HMC, posterior draws are usually at highly autocorrelated. For independent draws, [ \text{variance of simulation mean} \propto \frac1N ] where $N$ is the sample size, but for correlated draws, one has to scale the sample size with a factor [ \tau = \frac{1}{1+2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \rho_k} ] where $\rho_k$ is the lag-$k$ autocorrelation.</description>

      <title>Getting a nice &#43;= in LaTeX math</title>

      <description>I am working on an appendix for a paper that uses MCMC, and I decided to document some change of varible calculations in the interest of reproducibility (they are quite complex, because of multivariate determinants). But how can I typeset them nicely in $\LaTeX$?
\mathtt{target} += J_f  gives $$ \mathtt{target} += J_f $$ which is to be expected, as + is a binary operator and = is a relation, so $\LaTeX$ is not expecting them to show up this way.</description>

      <title>Two tricks for change of variables in MCMC</title>

      <description>Change of variables are sometimes advantageous, and occasionally inevitable for MCMC if you want efficient sampling, or to model a distribution that was obtained by a transformation. A classic example is the lognormal distribution: when
$$\log(y) \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$
one has to adjust the log posterior by $-\log y$ since
$$\frac{\partial \log(y)}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{y}$$
and
$$\log(1/y) = -\log(y).$$
In Stan, one would accomplish this as
target += -log(y)  In general, when you transform using a multivariate function $f$, you would adjust by</description>
