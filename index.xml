      <title>Sampling variation in effective sample size estimates (MCMC)</title>

      <description>Introduction MCMC samples, used in Bayesian statistics, are not independent &amp;mdash; in fact, unless one uses specialized methods or modern HMC, posterior draws are usually at highly autocorrelated. For independent draws, [ \text{variance of simulation mean} \propto \frac1N ] where $N$ is the sample size, but for correlated draws, one has to scale the sample size with a factor [ \tau = \frac{1}{1+2\sum_{k=1}^\infty \rho_k} ] where $\rho_k$ is the lag-$k$ autocorrelation.</description>

      <description>I am in the process of rebuilding my personal website using Hugo. I tried various themes, including hugo-academic, but in the process of adapting them to my needs I realized that it is less work to write one from scratch.
The result is now 80% ready (blog works, automatic listing of research papers will take some more work), and the source is on Github. It is available under the CC-BY-SA license, feel free to adapt parts from it, not that there is anything special in there.</description>

      <title>Getting a nice &#43;= in LaTeX math</title>

      <description>I am working on an appendix for a paper that uses MCMC, and I decided to document some change of varible calculations in the interest of reproducibility (they are quite complex, because of multivariate determinants). But how can I typeset them nicely in $\LaTeX$?
\mathtt{target} += J_f  gives $$ \mathtt{target} += J_f $$ which is to be expected, as + is a binary operator and = is a relation, so $\LaTeX$ is not expecting them to show up this way.</description>

      <title>Two tricks for change of variables in MCMC</title>

      <description>Change of variables are sometimes advantageous, and occasionally inevitable for MCMC if you want efficient sampling, or to model a distribution that was obtained by a transformation. A classic example is the lognormal distribution: when
$$\log(y) \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$
one has to adjust the log posterior by $-\log y$ since
$$\frac{\partial \log(y)}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{y}$$
and
$$\log(1/y) = -\log(y).$$
In Stan, one would accomplish this as
target += -log(y)  In general, when you transform using a multivariate function $f$, you would adjust by</description>

      <description>Firefox has been my primary browser for the last decade. I find it very fast and convenient, and use quite a few addons, including Google Scholar Button, NoScript, and uBlock Origin.
I can&amp;rsquo;t recall exactly when, but about half a year ago various sites started to break. I have not bothered to debug what&amp;rsquo;s happening, suspecting it was was a combination of various plugins, but continued to use Firefox and installed openwith to open broken pages in Chromium (yes, I know, the ultimate kludge).</description>

      <title>Continuous-time deterministic dynamic programming in Julia</title>

      <description>For the past few weeks I have been organizing pieces of code I have used to solve economic models into Julia packages. EconFunctions.jl is a collection of trivial functions that I noticed that I kept recoding/copy-pasting everywhere, occasionally making errors. ContinuousTransformations.jl is a library for manipulating various commonly used homeomorphisms (univariate at the moment), which are useful in functional equations or Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Finally ParametricFunctions.jl is for working with parametric function families.</description>

      <title>Blogging with Hugo, Julia, Weave.jl</title>

      <description>I have made a PR to Weave.jl which Matti Pastell kindly merged recently. This allows a relatively smooth workflow for blogging using the static website generator Hugo, and generating some pages with plots and evaluated Julia results. I made the source for my blog available so that others can use it for their own blogging about Julia. An example is this post.
The gist of the workflow is as follows:</description>

      <title>Teaching a course using Julia</title>

      <description>I just finished teaching a graduate course on practical aspects of dynamic optimization to our economics students. This year, for the first time, I taught the course using Julia, and this is a writeup of the experience. This was an intensive, 10-week course, with two classes per week, taught in the computer lab. A course on the theory of dynamic optimization was a prerequisite, this one was all about the actual numerical methods.</description>
